# pepper-robot
Tablet application which integrates with Pepper Robot to deliver a feedback survey


Specs used by me locally:
- Choreographe IDE (version 2.5)
- NAOqi (version 2.4) - Robot
- Windows OS

Some things to mention:
Choreographe does allow to connect to a virtual robot, however this program makes use of the tablet, and so a real robot would have to be used for the program to run on.

Also, the program makes use of Mailtrap (to send email results at the end), which is an online email server with free trial. So credentials would need to be passed through from your unique Mailtrap account if this feature is to be used.
